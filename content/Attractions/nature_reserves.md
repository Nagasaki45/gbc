Caption: The nature reserves of Allone Aba and Tzipori river are just around the corner

Our place is situated between two nature reserves, the Alonei Aba nature reserve on the one side and the Tzippori river nature reserve on the other side.
Aloney Aba is a 235-acres nature reserve, home to the Valonia oak trees and Palestine oak.
The Tzippori Brook flows down the Nazareth Mountains through the valley below the village, where Eyn Yivka spring is located.
The spring flows into a large pond with walls constructed during the Roman period.
The spring is surrounded by pomegranate orchards and green patches of grass, which stretch over an old road along the river leading to the Carmelite Monk Wheat Mill from the Ottoman period.
You can tour the national reserves by hiking or by bicycle (bicycle rental available at 24 hrs notice).
