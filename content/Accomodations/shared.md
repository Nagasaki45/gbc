Staying at the communal dormitory in our big Bedouin tent offers unique
experience of the lower Galilee.

The tent is well adjust to the climate of the area: In winter time the
whole place is heated by a wood stove and by summer visitors can feel
the smooth breeze coming from the sea through Tzippori river.

In the main tent you can find mattresses and pillows, as well as
comfortable seating area near the stove. Linen and towels are also
supplied.
