Slug: hole

We saw this special curved rock while ago when it was in the middle of
our horse's stable.

Recently, when we started to work on the camplodge garden we decided to
dug it out. The dipper we dug we realized that it has a round shape and
it can collect water naturally, as it already happenedÂ underground.

Last Saturday, with a little help from some friends, we dug it all the
way to it's rocky bottom. Soon will come the rain which will do its part
of the work: cleaning the mud and filling the hole with water.

What will be next with the hole? We still does't know.

But you can help us to decide...
