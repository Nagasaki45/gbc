Our farm animals will make sure you're fed well: Hannale and Leale are in charge of our diary and the chickens, with Zecaria the roster at the lead, stroll and feed around our yard and provide us with excellent eggs for your morning omelet.
We also share our self-grown vegetables and fruits, depending on the season.
We bring fresh bread every morning from the village bakery, and serve the breakfast neatly on a tray.
Our spoiling breakfast will charge you with positive energies for the wonderful coming day.
